# 🏥 Cancer Incidence & Mortality Analysis Dashboard
## *Empowering Healthcare Decisions Through Data-Driven Insights*

> **A comprehensive Tableau-based analytics solution that identifies socioeconomic disparities in cancer outcomes across U.S. regions, enabling targeted healthcare interventions for Rochester Regional Health.**

---

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

I developed this **end-to-end data analytics solution** to address a critical healthcare challenge: understanding how socioeconomic factors impact cancer incidence and mortality rates across the United States. This project demonstrates my ability to transform complex healthcare data into actionable business intelligence that directly supports strategic decision-making.

**Problem Statement:** Rochester Regional Health needed to identify regions with the highest cancer mortality rates and understand the socioeconomic factors driving these disparities to allocate healthcare resources effectively.

**My Solution:** I created an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes 32,552 data points across 19 key variables, revealing critical insights about cancer outcomes, poverty levels, and income disparities across four U.S. regions.

**Key Value Proposition:** This dashboard enables healthcare organizations to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, identify high-priority intervention areas, and develop targeted healthcare strategies that can save lives.
